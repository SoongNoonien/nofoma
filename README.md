# The GAP package nofoma

This package computes maximal vectors, the Frobenius normal form and
the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of a (square) matrix over any field 
that is available in GAP. In particular, it extends the already existing
GAP function `MininmalPolynomial` by computing also a vector whose local
minimal polynomial is equal to the minimal polynomial of a given matrix.

To install the package, just unpack the tar file inside the pkg directory
of your GAP installation. 

Then you can load the package into GAP by typing `LoadPackge("nofoma");`
